# Konquest_DiabetesPredictor

Diabetes mellitus is a group of diseases characterized by symptoms of chronic hyperglycemia and is becoming one of the world’s most challenging epidemics, symptoms of which include excessive urination, and changes in eating habits. Diabetes is caused when there is an excess of sugar in one's bloodstream. What’s more alarming is that even in present times people who are suffering from this may not know that they already have it until its too late. This being our theme, we present our project, Diabetes Predictor.

This project aims to create an AI-powered diabetes diagnosis and stage classification system. The system will use machine learning algorithms to analyze various medical indicators, including glucose levels, blood pressure, and body mass index, to determine whether an individual has diabetes and what stage they are currently in. The results of this analysis will be presented in an easy-to-understand format, providing patients with an accessible and accurate diagnosis. The goal of this project is to help individuals understand their diabetes status, encourage early intervention, and improve patient outcomes. By leveraging the power of AI, this project aims to transform the way diabetes is diagnosed and managed, ultimately improving the quality of life for those affected by this disease. What’s more, is that users can also get recommendations on what their should consist of so that they can maintain a healthy lifestyle.
